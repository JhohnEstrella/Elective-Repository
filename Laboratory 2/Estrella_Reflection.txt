My branding was inspired by modern and minimalist aesthetics that are commonly seen today, as I wanted a design that feels simple yet professional. I chose my color palette with this theme in mind, focusing on tones that appear clean, subtle, and visually balanced without being overwhelming. The biggest challenge in creating the logo was finding the right way to market myself to my audience while keeping the design minimal and not overdoing the elements. I had to carefully decide which details to include and which to leave out to maintain clarity and impact. This process helped me understand the importance of restraint and intentional design. I plan to use this branding in my future endeavors, not only in my academic work but also as I transition into my professional career.
