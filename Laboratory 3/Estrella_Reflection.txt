The easiest design to create was the profile banner, as it allowed me to clearly apply my branding without overcrowding the layout. I used the color scheme and typography from my brand kit to maintain consistency and strengthen my visual identity. To ensure readability, I applied strong contrast by pairing dark backgrounds with light font colors and vice versa. I also established visual hierarchy by adjusting font sizes and styles, making the most important information stand out first. This helped guide the viewer’s attention in a clear and organized way. Through this process, I learned that creating social media graphics is not as simple as it seems. Designers must carefully consider how audiences view the content and how they will react to the message being presented.
